Nintendo was founded as Nintendo Koppai on 23 September 1889 by craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi in Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto, Japan, as an unincorporated establishment, to produce and distribute Japanese playing cards, or karuta (かるた; from Portuguese *carta*, \\'card\\'), most notably *hanafuda* (花札, \\'flower cards\\').
