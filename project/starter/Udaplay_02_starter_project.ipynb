Not only do all the four characters have different special abilities and power ups, but certain characters are mandatory for some star missions. [...] Wario is the only character strong enough to break black-colored bricks as well as other certain formidable large objects that others can't. His strength also lets him punch, kick, and throw enemies the farthest as well as ground pound pegs once instead of three times. In VS. Mode, he can knock out opponents slightly longer, grab, spin, and throw them, like how Bowser is defeated. He can grab and throw signs and ground-pound them once, while others do it twice. His height is tied with Luigi's. [...] When beginning the game, you will start as Yoshi as Mario, Luigi, and Wario were captured and locked away in Peach's room by Bowser and his army. You need to find the corresponding keys to unlock their characters. Once you do, you can switch between the characters by entering the room they were locked inside. To switch back to Yoshi, you must have the character re-enter the room they were locked in.\\n\\n## Mario\",\n",
